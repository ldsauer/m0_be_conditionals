# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    - A conditional is usful to have in your code when you have multiple arguments and are trying to get a certain return value using a combination of the different arguments. 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - Well I accidnetally cloned this fork twice into my computer and that lead me to keep thinking that I was messing up even though my code looked fine. I could figure out where I was going wrong for the longest time. Once I figured out I was running the wrong ruby file everything workded out just fine! So if I could do the assignment over again I would make sure the other clone was deleted from my local drive and I was running the proper code!
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    - What brought me the most satisfaction was when I finally ran the correct file and I was getting the return values I was wanting! I got a little frustrated and almost deleted everything but I was confident that my methods were correct so I decided to keep it and come back to it later. Seeing my methods print correctly brought me immense satisfaction!!
